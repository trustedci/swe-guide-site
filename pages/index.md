Welcome to the TrustedCI Software Engineering Guide. This guide is geared towards the scientific community who has to write or maintain software as part of their job and would like some guidance on how to write secure software.

Please use the levels listed on the menu. Please note that each level builds on the previous level(s), so going through all the levels is a good starting point. We do not offer suggestions on what the best tools are at the time of this writing. However, we do provide the information for you, the reader, to find the tools that best fit the needs of your project.
