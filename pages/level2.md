This level of secure software engineering is intended for with software that will be developed by a team and/or distributed for use by more than the developer(s).  This software:

- May have any number of developers, including developers who aren't local to one another
- May be distributed to people outside the development team for their use
- Does not include any network-connected services

Teams developing at Level 2 should be doing all of the Level 1 requirements, including: using *revision control*, *documenting dependencies and build process*, creating and maintaining *build Infrastructure*, communicating the software's *development status*, and adding a *license* to the software.

In this chapter, we cover additional Level 2 requirements:

1. Revision Control Workflow
2. Semantic Versioning
3. Change Log
4. Distributing software
5. Code signing
6. Basic security policy, including vulnerability management
7. Dependency selection
8. Succession
9. Issue tracker
10. Testing

### Revision Control Best Practices [TODO]

At level 1, you already learned that it is necessary to use revision control.  However, for small projects that must be understood by at most one or two people, and available as historical artifacts, *how* the revision control system is used may not be that important.  When working with a team, or expecting outsiders to be able to navigate your repository, some additional care is required in maintaining the repository and communicating about its contents.

#### Branches

The different tracks of changes are called branches and will have at least a master branch. This branch should have the latest production code. This branch is also where versioning happens, which we will talk about later in this chapter.  Other branches often include:

* Development -- This is where active development happens before it is ready to be included in the master branch

* Testing -- Any code that needs testing should be here. It often intertwines a lot with the Development branch as code is modified.

* Individual contributor branches -- This is a good place for developers to apply patches to test without bothering the development and testing branches.

### Semantic Versioning

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org) may sound nitpicky, but it's an invaluable tool for ensuring that your software will be installed and maintained correctly wherever it's going.  No matter how good your other methods of communication are, your version number is the primary way of telling consumers of your software what a particular update means.

Semantic versioning, as explained at the link above, is a specific, widely-adopted way of determining the version number for a piece of software.  Because most people who administer your software will be responsible for hundreds or thousands of software packages, they won't be able to read every mailing list message or issue queue note to find out whether your update will break anything, or contains an important security patch.  Making your version numbers predictable and understandable solves the problem nicely, and can greatly reduce frustration among consumers of your software, without any real cost to you.

### Change Log


### Distributing software

Distribution of software should be made as easy as possible. Aside from having a source version kept in reversion control, having folks that can update the binary in package managers is important. This will easily allow system administrators to push software updates automatically. If a project wants to be publicly available, having the software in package managers will also make it easy for folks to install your software on their system. An INSTALL text file should also be included with the source code. This should give the steps to install the software and as much of it should be scripted.

### Code signing

Code signing lets people verify that the code they have has not been altered or corrupted since the source code was signed by the author(s). When choosing how to sign code, not only the certificate itself has to be trusted to verify the code is correct, but the certificate authority has to be trusted as well to verify the certificate. The common certificate authority will be built in with the operating system. However, some companies may have their own internal authority to issue the certificates. In cases of a single developer, the developer may self-sign their code. In that case, getting the public key for the certificate has to be verified from the developer. This can be done either by talking to the developer in person, or through verification of trusted people between you and the developer. Certificates should follow current cryptography standards and have a time stamp when time certificate expires and should no longer be trusted.

### Basic security policy, including vulnerability management

A good security policy should protect the project in the sense of not publicly releasing code vulnerabilities. Communication between the developers and the folks who found a vulnerability should be kept secure, as well as any documentation. Once a vulnerability has been patched, push the patch to become available to the public so that the users can get the fix. Understand that developers can make mistakes and no one is perfect. If a vulnerability does become public knowledge before a patch gets released, have a system in place to work with the users of the software to keep them well informed of what you are doing to mitigate the vulnerability. Good communication with your user base is important. Items to communicate with the users is the timeline for the patch to be released, what the users can do in the short term to protect their system as a temporary fix, and how they can get the patch as soon as it is released.

### Dependency selection

Choosing what dependencies are required for your software to run is critical. Not only should it be able to show it is secure, it should be accessable on the target machines. Such situations could be that a dependency is not on the authorized list for a machine, the machines don't have access to the outside internet, or a user may not have access privilages on the machine to install dependencies. When it comes to dependencies that are secure, you should include it with the source package so that it can be compiled locally on the machine along with your software. Having a copy of the dependencies with your source also means you can include additional testing and other security practices with it that can be forwarded to your customers.

### Succession

When it comes for the life of the software, having other core developers who can take over as lead for the project is known as succession planning. These developers should be able to take over the lead of the project within one working day if the current project lead leaves the project. The reasons for a project lead to leave a project is quite varied, ranging from an accident on their way to the office to health issues to being pulled from the project. The person who takes over as the new project lead should have access to the entire project to do anything and have contact with anyone involved, such as developers, helpful end users, the funding agency, and any support folks.

### Issue tracker

Issue tracking allows for maintaining a record of any bugs that come up in your software. No one writes perfect code all the time and things happen. A good issue tracker will allow you to:

* Track who is working on the bug.

* What file(s) and line(s) the bug is found.

* Make the report publically viewable or viewable to only a few people.

* Track the status of the changes.

* Write up a short report on how the bug was fixed and how to get the patch.

This provides not only good communication to the people using the software at the time, but offers a way to show a clear path that can be reproduced by others.

### Testing

Having a series of tests does wonders for all developers from the early stages of writing software. It allows you to not only know when a change you make breaks something, but you can also test what happens when bad input is given. Any good testing suite will let you define two names for each test. One to break the tests into groups (such as a set of tests for a class) and the other to name each individual test. The tests should be run in it's own main file to allow the choice of the main program or tests to be built. Using a tool to automate compiling your code will make this much easier, especially with larger code bases.

It allows the users of your software (including yourself!) to report situations where the code does not work properly. Any good issue tracker will allow the developers to mark each issue as publicly available or available to only a few people. It will also allow assignment of issues to people on the project and allow to attach information about fixing the issue to the issue itself. A good tracker will also notify the right people (including the person who submitted the issue) when the patch fixing the issue has been applied and where to find the changes. Issue tracking adds an additional level to testing. It points out things to test down the road so that any future changes do not break a patch. This can be done by either by working around the patch with the new code or modifying the patch to work with the additional code without breaking.
