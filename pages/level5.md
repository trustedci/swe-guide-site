Be sure to review the requirements of levels 1 through 4 before continuing here. We will be building on what was talked about in those sections.

At this point, the policy should be looking at large organizations who use many pieces of software to work towards it's goal. It should include things such as how to deal with attacks on the services, public interaction, and what software the organization is okay with running.

Having an external reviewer taking a look at your code base can find some issues you and your team may have glossed over. As one becomes more and more involved with a project, the blinders tend to come on and it becomes difficult to find issues that an outsider might spot right away. This is due to the fact that one just gets so use to seeing the same project, they make some assumptions about the project in their head, regardless of it being intended or not. The external reviewer should come into the project with a fresh set of eyes and give feedback on what issues they find.

By this point, any software being developed is going to be getting regular updates to it. The cyclical process should be a set of steps that all changes go through. For example, a change should go through a design phase, a coding phase, a testing phase, and then a review phase. This will allow any major change be well documented and thought out to make sure the software remains of high quality.
