## Introduction 

We all want software to have fewer vulnerabilities.  There are many [excellent resources](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/mist/SoftwareSecurityCourse/) out there on secure coding, some [specifically written for science and CI audiences](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5047a5a6e4b0dcecada15549/t/5638f207e4b0476111ac2b56/1446572551987/MillerHeymann_VulnerabilitiesThreatsAndSecureCodingPractices_NSF+Summit+2015.pdf).  So why isn't our code secure yet?

Programmers don't generally get up in the morning and decide to write the worst possible code (except for you folks working in [INTERCAL](http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/)--you know who you are).  Programmers tend to write the best code that they think they can, given the conflicting pressures that they are under, their skills and knowledge, the resources at hand, and the quality of their tools.  One piece of improving this picture is teaching secure coding practice, as that can help with the skills and knowledge of the programmers.  Fixing conflicting pressures, perverse incentives, and resourcing issues are management issues and beyond the scope of this document.  What we'll cover here is a third, crucial piece of the puzzle: **ensuring that the tools and engineering practice surrounding a software development project are sufficient to make it practical, or at least possible, for programmers to do the right thing most of the time**.
