Having an external reviewer taking a look at your code base can find some issues you and your team may have glossed over. As one becomes more and more involved with a project, the blinders tend to come on and it becomes difficult to find issues that an outsider might spot right away. This is due to the fact that one just gets so use to seeing the same project, they make some assumptions about the project in their head, regardless of it being intended or not. The external reviewer should come into the project with a fresh set of eyes and give feedback on what issues they find.
