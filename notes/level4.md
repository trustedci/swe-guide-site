[x] Review of level 1-3 requirements
[x] Next iteration on policy
[x] Adding static analysis, when available, to testing process
[x] Winning the expectations game
[] Formal change reviews
[] Maturing security exercise programs
[] Release cycle management
[] Understanding downstream to ultimate deployments

Be sure to review the requirements of levels 1 through 3 before continuing here. We will be building on what was talked about in those sections.

Need content on policy next iteration. Will need to speak with Susan on that -KSW

By this point, static analysis should be added whenever possible to the testing process. This is a process that happens without actually compiling or running any code to find any possible bugs or vulnerablities. Tools used for static analysis should be available to automaticlly review your code.

Any solid team needs to have expectations of it's members in order to work well together and suceed at a goal. When the goal of a team is writing a piece of software, these expectations can play a big part in not only if the project suceeds or not, but even if the company continues to do well or if it has to shut it's doors. Each person working on the team should know what their roles are, the importance of each role, and how to communicate with others on what the status is. How the team works together on a day to day basis can be the difference on expectation management and winning the game. If two team members are always at each other throats, not only will they not work well together to meet expectations, but it puts a drain on the rest of the team's expectations. No one wants to upset another person if they worry that other person is going to get angry at them. This becomes an even larger issue if the project lead is easy to anger or does not communicate expectations well. While not everyone on the team should be friends outside of the office, there should be enough friendly communication during the working hours. A little humor here can go a long way. Each team member needs to have a set of expectations for what they are responsible for on an individual level and on a team-wide level. How should the team handle bug reports that contain a new vulnerability? Who can know about new features at what point? Who is responsible for public relations?
